Once you clone project you may now install all gems by running two commands:
<gem install bundler>
<bundle install>

Node that all gems are listed in Gemfile in root of the project. If you would like to add/update/delete gem, you would now do it in 
Gemfile

once all gems installed, you can run WebDriver or API tests by using profiles listed in cucumber.yml file.

<cucumber -p api> for example
